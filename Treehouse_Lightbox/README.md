# Lightbox - Treehouse Project
---
## 1. What This Project Does
This is a simple app implementing the behavior of a photo gallery with a lightbox effect, where the browser displays a larger version of the selected thumbnail enlarged on the screen with all other content dimmed, and some description text beneath the image.

## 2. How To Set This Up
If you want to clone this project for yourself, the process is very simple due to the structure of the project.

1. Either manually download and unzip files to a location, or clone this repo through Git.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser. This project is built on HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/jQuery and the necessary resources from Bootstrap and FontAwesome are linked through the HTML file, so there is no need to install any packages through NPM.

## 3. Project Goals
This was done to get more familiarity with jQuery selectors, as well as using jQuery variables to store DOM elements, manipulate their contents/attributes, and hide/show them as necessary. Particular emphasis on getting exposure to more jQuery selectors such as .children() to make code more declarative vs imperative, and functions such as .attr() and .text() for content manipulation. 

## 4. Link to Live Site

## 5. Roadmap
Complete

## 6. Real Life
Turns out I just got a chance to re-use this code for a client, with some minor changes to fit the locations of their images on the page! Check it out in this ASP file [here](https://github.com/stern-shawn/Treehouse_Projects/blob/master/Treehouse_Lightbox/inlineVariant.asp)
